<h2>Motivation</h2>


Many of us love reading books, but we don't have the time in the day to enjoy all the books in the world. That is why choosing a book to spend our precious time is important. I always read reviews of books that pique my interest before deciding on investing my time to read them. Most of the time, the reviews save me from wasting time on a book that wasn't good or well-written objectively. I wanted a website to just see reviews of books and have a place to store these books in a digital library.

Writer's Road is a website where you can create an account, search for books, add to your library, and write reviews. It's a great place to share your thoughts and ideas about an author or novel and help you decide what your next book will be instead of hoping a book will be good.
